## Project Overview: 
This is a repository for Info-201's final group project.  We will be making an interactive apps/html that visualizes video game related information.

## Our Data Set:
Weâ€™ll be working with the Internet Games Database(IGDB), a community-driven site that gathers and shares game-related information. The data is collected by IGDB.com, and we gain access through its API. 

## Interaction: 
The user can visualize the information about video game by manipulating interacting with the widgets in the side panel.
In the tab of "Genre Distribution", the user can enter a particular release year and check different genre types to compare the proportions shown in the pie graph. Information about the least popular genre and the most popular genre in the selected year is also shown above the pie graph. 

In the tab of "Gaming Rating Summary", the users can type and select a particular genre, theme, and franchise. They also can adjust the range of the year and check the option of showing base games only. The corresponding line plot will be shown in the main panel based on the selected values. A summary, which includes the total number of games in the selected categories, the highest rated game, the lowest rated game, average rating, the average rating of the games, the standard deviation of the games and the average score of the group, is shown below the line plot. 

In the tab of "Game Hotness Gauge", the users can select one measurement of a particular game that they are interested in, and the gauge chart will show the value of the selected game in the selected measurement. A picture and an overview of the selected game are shown below the gauge chart.
